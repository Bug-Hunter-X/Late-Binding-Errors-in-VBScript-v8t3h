This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to late binding and provides a solution using early binding.  Late binding can lead to runtime failures if an object or method is not available, while early binding provides better error detection but is more complex to implement. The `lateBindingBug.vbs` file shows an example of a late binding error, and `earlyBindingSolution.vbs` illustrates how to resolve this using early binding.
